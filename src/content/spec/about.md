# About 
I am someone who loves to try and understand the inner workings of various technologies. This lead to the creation of my blog wherein I can write about the topics that I find interesting.

My technical interests include:
 - Operating Systems
 - Computer Networks
 - Reverse Engineering
- Cybersecurity (I'm currently going through THM)

I enjoy playing video games (mostly single player stuff like Yakuza and RPGs), watching anime, cycling and tinkering with automobiles.
